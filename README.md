# Sales Performance Dashboard
# The Ecommerce Sales Performance Dashboard provides a detailed analysis of key business metrics, offering insights into revenue, profit, and sales trends. Built using data processed through Python and SQL, this dashboard effectively combines robust data handling with interactive visualizations. At the top, it displays three Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): a total revenue of 161K, a profit of 26K, and 2008 items sold. Filters for quarter and city allow users to refine the displayed data and analyze specific segments.
# The dashboard features various visualizations for in-depth insights. A bar chart shows revenue generated by different states, with Maharashtra contributing the most, followed by Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. Another chart highlights customer contributions to revenue, where Hariwansh emerges as the top customer. A donut chart displays the quantity sold by product categories, with one category dominating at 63%. Similarly, another donut chart reveals payment mode preferences, with one mode accounting for 44% of transactions.
# Profit performance by month is depicted in a bar chart, with January recording the highest profit among the first-quarter months. Additionally, a horizontal bar chart breaks down profit by sub-category, with Printers and Phones leading in profitability, while Bookcases and Sarees contribute less. This dashboard, powered by Python and SQL for data extraction, transformation, and analysis, provides an interactive and visually engaging way to explore ecommerce sales data.
